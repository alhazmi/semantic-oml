# semantic-oml
This is a special version of the Orbit Measurement Library (OML) [1].
It supports semantic collection and representation of measurement and monitoring data in ICT infrastructures.
It uses the Monitoring Ontology for Federated Infrastructures (MOFI) [2] as an information model,
along with other ontologies that describe resources, components, services, infrastrcutres and further concepts and relations in ICT environments.
These ontologies together form a larger ontology, called Open Multinet (OMN) [3]. 
MOFI represent the monitoring part of the OMN ontology.
