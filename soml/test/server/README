Collection points (oml2-server) Tests
====================================

Tests in this directory ensure proper decoding of the OML protocol by the
collection components.

The following tests are currently present:
 - check_server: unit of the marshalling/interpretation of the binary/text
   protocols code;
 - msggen: macro test of the decoding logic of the proxy message loop; msgloop
   implements that logic by reading content from msggen.rb on its STDIN (each
   line prefixed by a custom text header starting with 'OML' followed by an 8-hex
   seqno and an 8-hex length fields), and outputing its interpretation to STDOUT
   (headers then text), for msggen to compare to its expectations;
 - issue610: test case for a reported bug where the timestamp sent in text mode
   would not be properly recorded [0].
 - selftest: test case for server instrumentation. Starts a stub python client
   which connects and disconnects and has the server log these events to itself.
