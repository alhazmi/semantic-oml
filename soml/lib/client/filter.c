/**\file filter.c
 * \brief OML's client side filter engine
 *
 * \publicsection \page filters In-line filtering
 *
 * The C OML client library allows to process the content of Measurement
 * Streams as they are generated and sent to the Collection Point.
 *
 * This is done by selecting the relevant fields of an MP, and applying the
 * desired filter on them. The easiest way to do so is through the use of a
 * configuration file, as documented in liboml2.conf(5).
 *
 * A few standard filters are available; fewer are documented:
 * \li \subpage stddev_filter
