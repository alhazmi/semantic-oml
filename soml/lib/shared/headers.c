/** \page omsp OML Measurement Stream Protocol (OMSP)
 *
 * The OML Measurement Stream Protocol is used to describe and transport
 * measurement tuples between Injection Points and Processing/Collection
 * Points. All data injected in a Measurement Point (MP) (with \ref
 * omlc_inject) is timestamped and sent to the destination as a
 * Measurement Stream (MS).
 *
 * The liboml2 provides an \ref api "API"
 * allowing to generate this MSs using this protocol and send them to
 * a remote host, or store them in a local file.
 *
 * Upon connection to a collection point, a set of \ref omspheaders "headers"
 * is first sent, describing the injection point (protocol version, name,
 * application, local timestamp), along with the \ref omspschema "schemata of
 * the transported MSs".
 *
 * Once done, timestamped measurement data is serialised, either using a
 * \ref omspbin "binary encoding", or a \ref omsptext "text encoding".
 *
 * \section Generalities
 *
 * There are 5 versions of the OML protocol.
 *
 * - OMSP V1 was the initial protocol, inherited from OML (version 1!);
 * - OMSP V2 introduced more precise types (<a
 *   href="http://git.mytestbed.net/?p=oml.git;a=shortlog;h=28daef3f">commit:28daef3f</a>),
 *   and was released with OML 2.4.0;
 * - OMSP V3 introduced changes to the binary protocol to support blobs and,
 *   incidentally, longer marshalled packets (<a
 *   href="http://git.mytestbed.net/?p=oml.git;a=shortlog;h=6d8f0597">commit:6d8f0597</a>),
 *   and was released with OML 2.5.0;
 * - OMSP V4 was introduced with OML 2.10.0; its main additions are the support
 *   for the definition of new Measurement Points (and Measurement Stream
 *   Schemas) at any time, and the ability to inject metadata.
 * - OMSP V5 which is the current, most recent and implemented version (since
 *   OML 2.11); its main advantages are the support for vectors, and the
 *   introduction of a DOUBLE64_T IEEE 754 binary64 for more precision in
 *   representing doubles in binary mode (vectors only).
 *
 * The protocol is loosely modelled after HTTP. The client first start
 * with a few \ref omspheaders "textual headers", then switches into
 * either the \ref omsptext "text" or \ref omspbin "binary" protocol for
 * the serialisation of tuples, following a previously advertised \ref
 * omspschema "schema". Both modes include contextual information with
 * each tuple. There is no feedback communication from the server.
 *
 * The client first opens a connection to an OML server and sends a
 * header followed by a sequence of measurement tuples. The header
 * consists of a sequence of key/value pairs representing parameters
 * valid for the whole connection, each terminated by a new line. The
 * headers are also used to declare the schema following which
 * measurement tuples will be streamed. The end of the header section is
 * identified by an empty line. Each measurement tuple is then
 * serialised following the mode selected in the headers. For the
 * \ref omsptext "text mode", this is a
 * series of newline-terminated strings containing tab-separated
 * text-based serialisations of each element, while the
 * \ref omspbin "binary mode" encodes
 * the data following a specific marshalling. Clients end the session by
 * simply closing the TCP connection.
 *
 * \subsection kv Key/Value Parameters
 *
 * The connection is initially configured through setting the value of a few
 * property, using a key/value model. The properties (and their keys) are the
 * following.
 *
 * - `protocol`: OMSP version, as specified in this document. The
 *     \ref oml2-server "oml2-server" currently supports 1--4;
 * - `domain` (`experiment-id` in V<4): string identifying the experimental
 *     domain (should match `/[-_A-Za-z0-9]+/`);
 * - `start-time`: local UNIX time in seconds taken at the time the header is
 *     being sent (see <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/gettimeofday">gettimeofday(3)</a>),
 *     \ref timestamps "the server uses this information to rebase timestamps within its own timeline";
 * - `sender-id`: (`start_time` in V<4): string identifying the source of this
 *     stream (should match `/[_A-Za-z0-9]+/`);
 * - `app-name`: string identifying the application producing the
 *     a measurements (should match `/[_A-Za-z0-9]+/`), in the storage backend, this
 *     may be used to identify specific measurements collections (e.g., tables in SQL);
 * - `content`: encoding of forthcoming tuples, can be either `binary` for
 *     the \ref omspbin "binary protocol" or `text` for the \ref omsptext "text protocol".
 * - `schema`: describes the \ref omspschema "schema of each measurement stream".
 *
 * These parameters can only be set as part of the \ref omspheaders "headers",
 * and are not valid once the server expects serialised measurements (V<4).
 *
 * Since V>=4, key/value metadata can be sent along with tuples using the \ref
 * schema0 "schema 0", the rest of the key/value parameters presented here
 * are all invalid in schema 0, and will be rejected by the server, _except_
 * for key `schema` itself, allowing to (re)define schemata (*XXX* not including
 * schema 0?).
 *
 * \subsection timestamping Time-stamping and book-keeping
 * Regardless of the mode (\ref omspbin "binary" or \ref omsptext "text"), each
 * measurement tuple is prefixed with some per-sample metadata.
 *
 * Prior to serialising tuples according to their schema, three elements are
 * inserted.
 * - `timestamp`: a *double* timestamp in seconds relative to the
 *     `start-time` sent in the headers,
 *     \ref timestamps "the server uses this information to rebase timestamps within its own timeline";
 * - `stream_id:` an *integer* (marshalled specifically as a `uint8_t` in
 *      \ref omspbin "binary mode") indicating which previously defined schema
 *      this tuple follows;
 * - `seq_no:` an *int32* monotonically increasing sequence number in the
 *     context of this measurement stream.
 *
 * The order of these fields varies depending on the mode (\ref omsptext "text"
 * or \ref omspbin "binary").
 */
/**
 * \section omspheaders OMSP Headers
 *
 * The headers are text-based, and used to transfer the
 * \ref kv "key/value  parameters of the experiment".  All of them have to appear
 * exactly once, in the order they were introduced in \ref kv "that section".
 * The only exception is the `schema` key which needs to appear once for
 * every measurement stream carried by the connection.
 *
 * \subsection omspheadersexample Examples
 *
 * Protocol version 3 and below can only define MSs at the time headers are sent.
 *
 *     protocol: 3
 *     experiment-id: exv3
 *     start_time: 1281591603
 *     sender-id: senderv3
 *     app-name: generator
 *     schema: 1 generator_sin label:string phase:double value:double
 *     schema: 2 generator_lin label:string counter:long
 *     content: text
 *
 * Protocol version 4 added the possibility to declare MP after headers are
 * sent, though the use of the newly introduced _schema0_ metadata stream.
 * Here, MS `generator_d_sin` created by sending a tuple with subject `.` (the
 * experiment root), key `schema`, and a value representing the schema of
 * the new MS, including its schema number and stream name, using the text
 * protocol.
 *
 *     protocol: 4
 *     domain: exv4
 *     start-time: 1281591603
 *     sender-id: senderv4
 *     app-name: generator
 *     schema: 0 _experiment_metadata subject:string key:string value:string
 *     schema: 1 generator_d_lin label:string seq_no:uint32
 *     content: text
 *     
 *     0.163925        0       1       .       schema  2 generator_d_sin label:string phase:double value:double
