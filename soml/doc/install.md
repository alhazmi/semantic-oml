OML: The O? Measurement Library: Installation Instructions	{#install}
==========================================================

This guide documentates building OML from a source tarball or Git clone,
as well as the generation of an Android tree suitable for use with
CyanogenMod.  Please refer to file [README](@ref index) for instructions on using
using these programs.


For users
---------

If you just want to use OML, you probably downloaded this package as a
tarball. You'll however need some additional software packages (popt,
sqlite3, libxml2, postgresql), and their development headers. They
should be available from your distribution, e.g., for Debian,

    $ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libpopt-dev libsqlite3-dev \
        pkg-config libxml2-utils
    $ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev # Optional, for PostgreSQL support

Then, the standard UNIX `./configure && make` method works for this
package. Here's what to do:

    $ tar xvfz oml2-2.x.x.tar.gz
    $ cd oml2-2.x.x
    $ ./configure --help

(to see the configuration options), and then:

    $ ./configure [possible options]
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The most useful option to `configure` is the `--prefix` option, which
allows installation in a non-standard location. The default is
`/usr/local`. If you just use the default, the liboml2 library will be
installed in `/usr/local/lib`, and you should be able to link your
programs against it with a simple `-loml2` on the command line to the
linker. The server, proxy server, and oml2-scaffold will be installed in
`/usr/local/bin`, and should be in your standard `PATH`.

Another set of useful options are the `--with-pgsql*` ones. They allow
to specify the location of the PostgreSQL headers and sources. Most
notably, on Debian-based systems,
`--with-pgsql-inc=/usr/include/postgresql` is needed.

To install OML in your home directory, use:

    $ ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/usr	# For example
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Then you will probably need to add ${HOME}/usr/lib to your
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. To run the server, add
`${HOME}/usr/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable

The last command will also install the man pages. Starting points in the
documentation are:

    $ man 1 liboml2
    $ man 3 liboml2
    $ man 5 liboml2.conf

All functions in the API have their own man pages (see [liboml2(3)](http://oml.mytestbed.net/doc/oml/2.12/liboml2.3.html) for
starters).


For developers
--------------

If you want to modify or enhance OML, you probably checked out the
sources from the OML git repository at

    $ git clone git://mytestbed.net/oml.git

In that case, in order to build the package you first need to generate
the `configure` script and Makefiles. To do this, in addition to the
dependencies listed in the first section, you also need the Autotools
installed: Autoconf, Automake, Libtool as well as Gnulib. If you use a
Linux distribution, these should all be available via your system's
package manager. For example on Debian-ish systems:

    $ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool gnulib
    $ sudo apt-get install asciidoc texinfo \
        docbook-xml docbook-xsl xsltproc # Optional, for building documentation

Once you have installed the Autotools you should be able to generate all
the necessary configuration and Makefiles by using the `autogen.sh` script.

    $ cd oml
    $ ./autogen.sh

At this point you should be ready to run

    $ ./configure && make && sudo make install

as above.

By default the documentation will be built. The documentation is written
in Asciidoc markup language, so you'll need Asciidoc installed (`apt-get
install asciidoc` on Debian/Ubuntu). Code documentation based on Doxygen
markup is also generated. To disable building the documentation, use the
`--disable-doc` option to the configure script. To only disable Doxygen
documentation, use the `--disable-doxygen-doc` option.

    $ ./configure --without-doc

If you want to run the test suite you will also need to install the
CHECK package (a unit testing framework) [check].  It's also available
as a Debian package in the standard Debian and Ubuntu repositories:

    $ apt-get install check

If you don't install CHECK then the test suite won't be run, but OML
should still build and install correctly. To run the test suite, use the
`check` target:

    $ make check

If you prefer to keep your executables, object files, and other
generated files in a separate tree, Automake supports a parallel build
using GNU Make's `VPATH` feature. For instance, to build in a
subdirectory called 'build', do the following:

    $ mkdir _build
    $ cd _build
    $ ../configure [possible options]
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

All the files generated by `configure` and `make` will be put under the
build directory. Automake recognizes that `configure` was run in a
directory different to the root of the source tree, and adjusts its
behaviour accordingly.

Finally, if you want to restore the tree to a clean state, without the
generated Makefile, Makefile.in, and copied Autoconf/Automake/Libtool
files, do this:

    $ ./autoclean.sh

Once you do this, you'll have to follow the above procedure again to get
the tree into a state where you can build it.


Android builds
--------------

Building OML for Android consists in leveraging the native process. This
method requires a different set of source files, and cannot work with
your current tree. If you are working from a Git checkout, you can
generate this set of source files by running the following commands.

    $ ./configure --enable-packaging
    $ make pkg-and

This will create an archive named p-android/oml2-2.x.x-android.tar.gz.
Alternatively, you can find this archive at [oml-files]. That fileset
contains both the OML and libpopt source, as well as a [README](@ref index).oml2 file
documenting the build process in more details. Please refer to it for
further information on that matter.
