If a problem you are experiencing is not addressed in the FAQ
(http://oml.mytestbed.net/projects/oml/wiki/FAQ_and_Support) nor already
present in the list of know bugs
(http://oml.mytestbed.net/projects/oml/issues). You could discuss it on
the mailing list (details and archives at
http://oml.mytestbed.net/tab/show?id=oml).

It is however advisable to open a ticket on our issue tracker at
http://oml.mytestbed.net/projects/oml/issues/new. Don't forget to
include details such as client and server logs (at '[--oml-log-level|-d]
2'). It also helps if you can share the source code of a (minimal, if
possible) example reliably triggering the problem.

// vim: ft=asciidoc:tw=72
