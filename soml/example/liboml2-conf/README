Example OML configuration files
===============================

This directory contains sample OML configuration files that can be
used with the simple sine wave generator application. These are XML
files that allow the user to configure the operation of the client
and change its runtime behaviour in ways that often cannot be done
purely from the command line.

config.xml

   A simple configuration file that declares a single measurement
   stream and instantiates an averaging filter in the client process.

config_text_stream.xml

   Defines a single measurement stream which uses the text protocol to
   communicate to the server process.

config_two_streams.xml

   Define a pair of measurement streams for a single measurement
   point: the first being the normal sine wave generator and the
   second a moving average computed over the last ten readings.
